You are finalizing the FinChat web app. The app is already 70% complete. Apply the following updates to polish the experience, fix visual issues, and complete the design.

### 🎨 Branding and Logo

1. **Generate a random logo for FinChat**
   - Use a glowing, Gen-Z styled design
   - Apply it to the site header and also inside the Chat section (e.g., next to the assistant name or bubble)
   - Make sure it fits the neon/glassmorphic aesthetic

---

### 💬 Chat Section Enhancements

2. **Add a beautiful visual animation while the assistant is processing**
   - Replace static “thinking…” text with a glowing animation (e.g., pulsing dots, shimmer, or orbiting glow)
   - Also show dynamic feedback like:
     - “Analyzing your question…”
     - “Reasoning through data…”
     - “Synthesizing insights…”
   - Do not mention the model name (e.g., DeepSeek or OpenRouter) anywhere in the UI

3. **Remove all disclaimers from chat output**
   - Do not include any phrases like:
     - “We suggest you do your own research”
     - “This is not financial advice”
     - “Please consult a professional”
   - The assistant should respond with clarity and confidence, without disclaimers

### 📊 Market Overview in Chat Section

4. **Show 4 live market results directly in the Chat section**
   - Include price, % change, and sparkline
   - Below the 4 results, add a glowing animated button labeled “See More”
   - When clicked, it should smoothly transition the user to the Charts section

---

### 📉 Charts Section Fixes

5. **Fix delayed price loading**
   - Ensure prices appear instantly when the chart loads
   - Preload data if needed to avoid flicker

6. **Improve chart visuals**
   - Use TradingView Lightweight Charts with glowing lines and smooth transitions
   - Ensure time range selector (1m, 5m, 1h, 1d) works without lag

7. **Fix category selector UI**
   - The Crypto / Stocks toggle currently looks broken or ugly
   - Redesign it to match the rest of the site’s glowing aesthetic
   - Use animated transitions and clear active state indicators

---

### 🧭 Dropdowns and Selectors (Global Fix)

8. **Fix all dropdowns and category selectors across the site**
   - In Calculators, Tax Tool, News Filters, etc.
   - Ensure they open smoothly, look visually polished, and match the theme
   - Avoid janky transitions or misaligned elements
