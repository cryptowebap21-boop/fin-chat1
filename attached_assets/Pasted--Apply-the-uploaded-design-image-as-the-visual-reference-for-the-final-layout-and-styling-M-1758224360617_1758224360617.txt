**Apply the uploaded design image** as the visual reference for the final layout and styling.
   - Match the glow, spacing, typography, and UI flow shown in the image.
   - Ensure the site looks smooth, modern, and emotionally engaging.

3. **Remove all disclaimers or warning texts** that say:
   - “Don’t take inspiration from this”
   - “Don’t invest money based on this site”
   - “This site is not trustworthy”
   - Or anything similar that undermines the credibility of the platform

4. **Replace with a confident, clean footer or banner** that says:
   - “FinChat is built for clarity, speed, and trust. All data is sourced from reliable providers.”
   - Keep it short, elegant, and visually integrated into the design.

5. **Ensure the entire experience feels beautiful and smooth**
   - Transitions should be fluid
   - Charts should animate cleanly
   - Light/dark theme toggle should feel seamless
   - All sections (Chat, Markets, Charts, News, Calculators, Tax Tool) should load quickly and feel cohesive

6. **Do not change any of the data sources or architecture**
   - Crypto APIs: Binance WS, CoinGecko, CoinPaprika, Kraken, CryptoCompare
   - Stock APIs: Yahoo Finance RapidAPI (primary), Finnhub, MarketStack, Twelve Data
   - News feeds: All free RSS sources already integrated
   - Chat: ChatGPT-4o assistant
   - Calculators and Tax Tool: Already working or partially built — finish them cleanly

7. **Respect the existing theme and branding**
   - Gen-Z aesthetic: glowing neon, glassmorphism, animated gradients
   - Accent color: neon cyan/teal unless the uploaded image shows a different choice

8. **Do not expose any API keys**
   - All keys must be loaded from Replit Secrets using `process.env`
